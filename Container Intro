## VM:

- Lets first understand about Virtual Machine
- Lets say we have a Physical Server(eg:laptop), we dont use complete resources(cpu,ram,h/w) of our laptop server.
- Here, instead of paying for physical servers we use a new technology known as "Hypervisor" where we can run multiple VM's on a single physical server, along with its own OS an apps, attached with CPU and memory.
